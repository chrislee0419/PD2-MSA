# PAYDAY 2 - Mouse Sensitivity Additions Mod

At this stage, this mod plans to add two features (neither of which currently work): 
- enable players to set a mouse sensitivity outside of the default range of 0.3 to 1.7 (expanded to 0.05 to 2)
- allow players to set a secondary mouse sensitivity, which can be used on-demand via a keybind
